# Implementing Access Control with Express and MongoDB

This repository contains an implementation of access control using Express.js and MongoDB. The project aims to provide a basic authentication and authorization system that can be integrated into web applications, with fine-grained control over user access.

## Features

- User registration and login functionality
- Protected routes that require authentication and specific permissions
- Access control module based on the "accesscontrol" package

## Access Control

The access control module in this project is implemented using the "accesscontrol" package. It provides a flexible and intuitive way to define roles, permissions, and access rules within the application.

The access control configuration can be found in the `roles.js` file. It defines roles and their associated permissions, as well as the rules for accessing specific routes and resources. The middleware in the `permissionHandler.js` file is used to enforce the access control rules on protected routes.

The "accesscontrol" package allows you to easily manage and assign roles and permissions to users, as well as control access to routes and resources based on the user's role and permissions.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- bcrypt.js (for password hashing)
- accesscontrol (for role-based access control)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aish-26-2000/Implementing-accesscontrol-with-Express-MongoDB.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   cd Implementing-accesscontrol-with-Express-MongoDB
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the MongoDB connection:
   - Create a MongoDB database and obtain the connection URI.
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the `MONGODB_URI` variable with your MongoDB connection URI.

4. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. The server will start running on `http://localhost:5000`. You can now access the API endpoints and test the access control functionality.

## API Endpoints

- `/api/users/register` - Register a new user
- `/api/users/login` - User login
- `/api/workspaces/*` - routes related to workspaces
- `/api/docs/* ` - routes related to documents
